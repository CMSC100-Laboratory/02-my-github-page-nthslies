                I enjoy applying my artistic skills to everything I do, whether it’s on my school notes, projects, or even on myself. I believe that it helps me generate new ideas and concepts and express them freely to others. It is really helpful in my field since it allows me to think outside the box when solving problems.

                <!--description-->
                I make sure that everything that I do is thoroughly thought of a million times or more. It helps minimize or even prevent mistakes by reviewing everything over and over again, especially when people’s lives are on the line. Similar to codes, it enables me to spot little things that can be improved further.

            <p>Hi there! I'm Nathalie Faith U. Labramonte, and I am currently taking 
                my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of the Philippines Los Baños.
                I graduated from City of San Jose del Monte National Science High School with high honors.
                My hobbies include painting and reading, as well as solving puzzles like sudoku and kakuro.
                At first, I actually enjoyed math and had a dream to pursue accountancy,
                but what got me into computer science was my robotics class in high school.
                Up until now, I am still able to apply my mathematical knowledge as well as my love for crafting,
                but in a digital way like this one. I appreciate how my degree program 
                allows me to still pursue those things and helps me grow individually in different aspects as well.
                I aspire to continue chasing that shooting star without it fading eventually.
