## What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
- From this exercise, I realized that designing a website is hard, especially when it is static. I had a hard time trying to manipulate how each part of it would look and ensure that it works and presents accordingly. In addition, it helped me realize as well that there are still plenty of things that I didn't know about HTML and CSS. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this exercise so much because it allowed me to portray the creative side of me.
